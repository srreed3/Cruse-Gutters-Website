The Cruse Gutters project is a cohesive but not fully functional website designed to showcase the services and products of a gutter installation and repair company. The main page introduces the company, Cruse Gutters and Repairs LLC, with a welcoming header and a catchy tagline, "Call for a job done right!" The homepage provides essential company information, including a brief overview of services, customer ratings, and contact details. The layout is enhanced with strategically placed images depicting the company's work, giving visitors a visual understanding of the services offered. The site employs a clean and professional design with a consistent color scheme and intuitive navigation.

The "Product List" page offers a detailed catalog of the company's products, including gutters, gutter guards, downspouts, end caps, outlets, and elbows, complete with pricing and illustrative images. This page is structured to provide potential customers with clear and concise information about available products, facilitating informed decision-making. The "Contact Us" page features a comprehensive service request form that allows users to specify their needs, such as replacement, repair, or installation of gutter guards. This form also collects information about the type of home, the number of stories, and color preferences, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for accurate service provision. The overall design emphasizes usability and accessibility, ensuring a seamless user experience.
